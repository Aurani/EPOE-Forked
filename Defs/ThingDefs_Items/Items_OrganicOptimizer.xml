		<label>organic optimizing nanobots</label>
		<description>Advanced nanobots that can help to bring out the full potential of the natural body. It takes 3 days for the full process to complete the optimization, which does include requiring more rest and food needs. At the end of the process, the nanobots breaks down and dissolve without a trace as the treated body part no longer needs them.\n\nBody purist can accept or even be happy about the improvements, whilst transhumanists hates all of this.</description>
