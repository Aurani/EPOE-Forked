<SyntheticLung.label>synthetic lung</SyntheticLung.label>
<SyntheticLung.description>An advanced artificial lung. It has synthetic muscle fibers for a realistic breathing, plus a high-flow pump for rapid deep breathes during intensive activities. It is better than a biological lung in almost every way.</SyntheticLung.description>

<SyntheticLiver.label>synthetic liver</SyntheticLiver.label>
<SyntheticLiver.description>An advanced artificial liver. A set of sensors and chemical synthesizers monitors and replicate the liver's role in metabolism, instantly adapting to changes in the body. It is better than a biological liver in almost every way.</SyntheticLiver.description>

<SyntheticKidney.label>synthetic kidney</SyntheticKidney.label>
<SyntheticKidney.description>An advanced artificial kidney. A set of sensors and synthetic filters that efficiently removes waste products from the blood. It is better than a biological kidney in almost every way.</SyntheticKidney.description>

<MuscleStimulator.label>muscle stimulator</MuscleStimulator.label>
<MuscleStimulator.description>Through special chemicals and electric shocks this little chip is able to stimulate the muscles so they can operate at above maximum performance.</MuscleStimulator.description>

<AIChip.label>AI chip</AIChip.label>
<AIChip.description>Through special chemicals and electric shocks this little chip is able to completely restore the user's consciousness and mobility. Requires brain surgery research before installing.</AIChip.description>

<SyntheticSkin.label>synthetic tissue</SyntheticSkin.label>
<SyntheticSkin.description>A patch of organo-synthetic tissue which can replace damaged areas.</SyntheticSkin.description>

<NeuromuscularFramework.label>neuromuscular framework</NeuromuscularFramework.label>
<NeuromuscularFramework.description>A set of synthetic muscles and artificial nerves capable of perfectly recreating the function of a healthy torso.</NeuromuscularFramework.description>

<NeurocureFramework.label>neuro-cure framework</NeurocureFramework.label>
<NeurocureFramework.description>A set of highly advanced nanomachines, synthetic brain tissue and artificial nerves capable of restoring the function of a brain. Used for curing brain injuries, dementia and alzheimer.\n\nRequires Brain Surgery research to use.</NeurocureFramework.description>

<EPIA_SyntheticBone.label>synthetic bone</EPIA_SyntheticBone.label>
<EPIA_SyntheticBone.description>An adjustable synthetic bone that is ready to transform and mold into a replacement bone that has been lost or missing. Once installed, the synthetic bone's shape is permanently set and the material composition starts altering to become closer to the real thing, making it almost indistinguishable from the rest of the skeletal structure.</EPIA_SyntheticBone.description>
