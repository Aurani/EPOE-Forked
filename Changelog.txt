* Glitterworld implants can now be crafted, all requiring numerous MA-AI chips.
* New endgame research. New Organic Optimizers nanobots that improves the efficiency of the natural body. Body purists will like them, whilst Transhumanists hate them.
* Brain Stimulator changed from +100% consciousness, max 65% consciousness, to +70% consciousness, max 90% consciousness. Overall, this should be a buff, for below reason.
* AI Core implant reworked. The person with it should no longer be on murderous rage unless the implant is not maintained carefully through tending every 2 days by a doctor.
