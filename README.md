# Expanded Prosthetics and Organ Engineering - Forked #


## Overview ##

This mod is a continuation of Expanded Prosthetics and Organ Engineering, fixing some redundancies in code and balancing the advanced bionics in order to put them as a middle tier between bionics and archotech upgrades.
It also rebalances dninemfive's EPOE Replacement Expansion in order to bring it in line with the changes made in EPOE.

The original EPOE was not updated properly after version 1.0 of Rimworld came out, and as such made it so that advanced bionic parts gave twice as much efficiency as they should've, making them stronger than even archotech parts (e.g. Advanced Bionic Arms giving 70% more efficiency instead of 35%).

**ATTENTION:
If changing from the old EPOE version during mid-save, please remove all recipes from the EPOE workstations, as well as all surgery operations. Always make an original back-up save before committing to mod swaps.**

## Compatibility ##

This mod is compatible with every mod the original EPOE is compatible with, plus many more, as much of the code has been cleaned up and several external patches have been improved and incorporated into the mod.
The mod should be safe to add mid-save and remove as well, as long as the operation bills are all removed so as to avoid getting a UI error.

No longer needed due to integration:
* EPOE Replacement Expansion
* EPOE Trader and Archotech Patch
* EPOE Craftable Power Claws - Added a new production line for it
* EPOE LEGACY Body Climate Control - Wasn't functional, but now contains an integrated fix
* RePower EPOE Patch - Added the missing Tissue Printer changes.
* Finger and Toes for EPOE - Essentially the concept EPOE Replacement Expansion has already

Compatibility notes with other mods:
* Questionable Ethics Enhanced - Patched on our end to reduce duplications and our added natural body parts and organs should no longer be obtainable.

Incompatible mods:
* Rah's Bionics and Surgery Expansion
* Older versions of EPOE - This mod is a continuation of EPOE and thus doesn't need a second, outdated copy of it running at the same time.
